        <p>
          PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nice, but what does that mean? An example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."
          </li>
          <li>
            What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <p>Here we would like to show the very basics of PHP in a short, simple tutorial. This text only deals with dynamic web page creation with PHP, though PHP is not only capable of creating web pages. See the section titled What can PHP do for more information.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format. In this example we used <?php to indicate the start of a PHP tag. Then we put the PHP statement and left PHP mode by adding the closing tag, ?>. You may jump in and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this anywhere you want. For more details, read the manual section on the basic PHP syntax.
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>
            Now that you have successfully created a working PHP script, it is time to create the most famous PHP script! Make a call to the phpinfo() function and you will see a lot of useful information about your system and setup such as available predefined variables, loaded PHP modules, and configuration settings. Take some time and review this important information.

        <p>
          In this tutorial we assume that your server has activated support for PHP and that all files ending in .php are handled by PHP. On most servers, this is the default extension for PHP files, but ask your server administrator to be sure. If your server supports PHP, then you do not need to do anything. Just create your .php files, put them in your web directory and the server will automatically parse them for you. There is no need to compile anything nor do you need to install any extra tools. Think of these PHP-enabled files as simple HTML files with a whole new family of magical tags that let you do all sorts of things.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us say you want to save precious bandwidth and develop locally. In this case, you will want to install a web server, such as » Apache, and of course » PHP. You will most likely want to install a database as well, such as » MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can either install these individually or choose a simpler way. Our manual has installation instructions for PHP (assuming you already have some web server set up). If you have problems with installing PHP yourself, we would suggest you ask your questions on our » installation mailing list. If you choose to go on the simpler route, then » locate a pre-configured package for your operating system, which automatically installs all of these with just a few mouse clicks. It is easy to setup a web server with PHP support on any operating system, including MacOSX, Linux and Windows. On Linux, you may find » rpmfind and » PBone helpful for locating RPMs. You may also want to visit » apt-get to find packages for Debian.

    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$
      </p>
      <p>
        For our purposes here, a letter is a-z, A-Z, and the bytes from 128 through 255 (0x80-0xff).

        For information on variable related functions, see the Variable Functions Reference.
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>$var = 'Bob';</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
          <code>$foo = 'Bob'; </code> This always declares a global variable. It
          generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> $foo = 25;</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined. For the most part all PHP variables only have a single scope. This single scope spans included and required files as well. For example:
        </p>
        <code>$a = 1;
          include 'b.inc';</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>

        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
          not defined</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
      <header>Global variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
          or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
          frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
          declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
          iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
          The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
          and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>

        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
          scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
          assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>

        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>

        <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
          WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements }</code>
        However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
        statement is executed without problems.
        <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
          "otherValue";</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>Data types</header>
      <article>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
              <li>
                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                NULL, or any other variant.
              </li>
              <li>
                undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
              </li>
              <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
              <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
              <li>
                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                are unique and immutable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
        you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
        functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
        think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
        procedures that your application can perform.

    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
      <header>if...else statement</header>
      <article>
        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
        true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
        condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
        Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
        condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
        statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
        statement, including further nested if statements.
        <p>
          You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
          conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p>
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
          statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
          statement_last; }
        </code>
        In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
        which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
        statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
        general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
        when nesting if statements:

        <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
        It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
        expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
        glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
        an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
        additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

        <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
      <header>while statement</header>
      <article>
        A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
        condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

        <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
        false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
        the statement following the loop.

        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
          If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
          condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
          stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>

        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
          group those statements.
        </p>

        Example:

        <p>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        </p>

        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
      <header>Function declarations</header>
      <article>
        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
            curly brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named
          square:
        </p>

        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
          statement specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
          changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
          globally or in the calling function.
