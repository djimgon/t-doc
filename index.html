        <p>
          PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting
          language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nice, but what does that mean? An example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code
            that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special
            start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."
          </li>
          <li>
            What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the
            server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running
            that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to
            process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up
            your sleeve.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <header class="li2">Simple Example</header>
      <article>
        <p>Here we would like to show the very basics of PHP in a short, simple tutorial. This text only deals with
          dynamic web page creation with PHP, though PHP is not only capable of creating web pages. See the section
          titled What can PHP do for more information.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format. In this example we
            used <?php to indicate the start of a PHP tag. Then we put the PHP statement and left PHP mode by adding the closing tag, ?>
            . You may jump in and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this anywhere you want. For more details, read
            the manual section on the basic PHP syntax.
          </li>
          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>
            Now that you have successfully created a working PHP script, it is time to create the most famous PHP
            script! Make a call to the phpinfo() function and you will see a lot of useful information about your system
            and setup such as available predefined variables, loaded PHP modules, and configuration settings. Take some
            time and review this important information.

      <header>What Do I Need?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          In this tutorial we assume that your server has activated support for PHP and that all files ending in .php
          are handled by PHP. On most servers, this is the default extension for PHP files, but ask your server
          administrator to be sure. If your server supports PHP, then you do not need to do anything. Just create your
          .php files, put them in your web directory and the server will automatically parse them for you. There is no
          need to compile anything nor do you need to install any extra tools. Think of these PHP-enabled files as
          simple HTML files with a whole new family of magical tags that let you do all sorts of things.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let us say you want to save precious bandwidth and develop locally. In this case, you will want to install a
          web server, such as » Apache, and of course » PHP. You will most likely want to install a database as well,
          such as » MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can either install these individually or choose a simpler way. Our manual has installation instructions
          for PHP (assuming you already have some web server set up). If you have problems with installing PHP yourself,
          we would suggest you ask your questions on our » installation mailing list. If you choose to go on the simpler
          route, then » locate a pre-configured package for your operating system, which automatically installs all of
          these with just a few mouse clicks. It is easy to setup a web server with PHP support on any operating system,
          including MacOSX, Linux and Windows. On Linux, you may find » rpmfind and » PBone helpful for locating RPMs.
          You may also want to visit » apt-get to find packages for Debian.

      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>
        Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is
        case-sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or
        underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be
        expressed thus: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$
      </p>
      <p>
        For our purposes here, a letter is a-z, A-Z, and the bytes from 128 through 255 (0x80-0xff).

        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>$var = 'Bob';</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
          <code>$foo = 'Bob'; </code> This always declares a global variable. It
          generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
          variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> $foo = 25;</code> This
          syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="li7">
      <header>Variable Scope</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined. For the most part all PHP variables only
          have a single scope. This single scope spans included and required files as well. For example:
        </p>
        <code>$a = 1;
          include 'b.inc';</code>
        <p>
          Here the $a variable will be available within the included b.inc script. However, within user-defined
          functions a local function scope is introduced. Any variable used inside a function is by default limited to
          the local function scope. For example:
        </p>

        <code>$a = 1; /* global scope */

          function test()
          {
          echo $a; /* reference to local scope variable */
          }

          test();</code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="li8">
      <header>Global Variables</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          First, an example use of global:
        </p>
        <code>$a = 1;
          $b = 2;

          function Sum()
          {
          global $a, $b;

          $b = $a + $b;
          }

          Sum();
          echo $b;
        </code>
        <p>
          The above script will output 3. By declaring $a and $b global within the function, all references to either
          variable will refer to the global version. There is no limit to the number of global variables that can be
          manipulated by a function.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="li9">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during
          the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants). Constants are
          case-sensitive. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A valid constant name starts with a letter
          or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would
          be expressed thusly: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$
        </p>

        <p>
          It is possible to define() constants with reserved or even invalid names, whose value can only be retrieved
          with the constant() function. However, doing so is not recommended.
        </p>
        <code>// Valid constant names
          define("FOO", "something");
          define("FOO2", "something else");
          define("FOO_BAR", "something more");

          // Invalid constant names
          define("2FOO", "something");

          // This is valid, but should be avoided:
          // PHP may one day provide a magical constant
          // that will break your script
          define("__FOO__", "something");

        <p>Data Types define the type of data a variable can store. PHP allows eight different types of data types. All
          of them are discussed below. There are pre-defined, user-defined, and special data types.</p>

      <header>if...else Statement</header>
      <article>
        Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Very often when you
        write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements
        in your code to do this.
        In PHP we have the following conditional statements:
        <ul>
          <li>if statement - executes some code if one condition is true</li>
          <li>if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is
            false
          </li>
          <li>if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions</li>
          <li>switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed</li>
        </ul>
        <code>if (condition) {
          // code to be executed if condition is true;
          }
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="li12">
      <header>While Statement</header>
      <article>
        While loops are the simplest type of loop in PHP. They behave just like their C counterparts. The basic form of
        a while statement is:
        <code>while (expr)
          statement
        </code>
        <p>
          The meaning of a while statement is simple. It tells PHP to execute the nested statement(s) repeatedly, as
          long as the while expression evaluates to true. The value of the expression is checked each time at the
          beginning of the loop, so even if this value changes during the execution of the nested statement(s),
          execution will not stop until the end of the iteration (each time PHP runs the statements in the loop is one
          iteration). If the while expression evaluates to false from the very beginning, the nested statement(s) won't
          even be run once.
        </p>
        <code>/* example 1 */
          $i = 1;
          while ($i <= 10) {
          echo $i++; /* the printed value would be
          $i before the increment
          (post-increment) */
          }

          /* example 2 */

          $i = 1;
          while ($i <= 10):
          echo $i;
          $i++;

      <header>Type Declarations</header>
      <article>
        Type declarations can be added to function arguments, return values, and, as of PHP 7.4.0, class properties.
        They ensure that the value is of the specified type at call time, otherwise a TypeError is thrown.
        Every single type that PHP supports, with the exception of resource can be used within a user-land type
        declaration. This page contains a changelog of availability of the different types and documentation about usage
        of them in type declarations.
